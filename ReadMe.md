# OG Xbox Open Source File Manager

On **July 21st, 2002**, the very first homebrew file manager for the original Xbox, **boXplorer**, was released.  
It gave users direct control over their files long before dashboards and other tools came along.  
Unfortunately, the source code was never released, so enhancements and new features couldn’t be added.

This project is an attempt to **pay respect to that legacy** with a new **standalone** — and most importantly, **open source** — file manager for the original Xbox.

## ⚡ Status

- This is still in the **early stages of development**.  
- Some features are working (as shown in the preview video), but it hasn’t been thoroughly tested yet.  
- The groundwork is in place — and we want the community to help make it better.

## 🙌 Call to the Community

That’s why we’ve made it **open source**.  
We want *you* — the scene and community that keeps the OG Xbox alive — to:

- Fix bugs  
- Add features  
- Improve compatibility  
- Help turn this into the **go-to file manager for the original Xbox**

## 🛠️ How to Build / Run

- Build with your preferred toolchain (XDK / OpenXDK).  
- Copy the compiled `.xbe` to your Xbox.  
- ⚠️ **Important**: Copy the **Media** folder into the **same directory as the `.xbe`**, otherwise the app will fail to load (fonts won’t be found).
